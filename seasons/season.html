            <p><img src="home.jpg" class="pic"> Our seasons are what cause Earth's strange weather patterns along with its climate it has. This is becuase the Earth is tilted on an axis, and the weather in a certain location can be
              determined due to where it is at when then axis is tilted to a certain degree. Some places are affected by the seasons more than others. For insance somebody who lives by the equator usually only experinces warm sunny days,
            while a person living at the north pole normally only experiences fridged cold temperatures. In a place like Helena Montana normally will experience all of the four seasons, though it may feel like winter lasts the longest...</p>
