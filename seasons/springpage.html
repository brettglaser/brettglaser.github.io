            <p><img src="spring-tree.png" class="pic">Spring is the time of the year where the weather starts to get warmer, the days start to become longer, and the snow finally starts to melt away, and the trees and flowers start to bloom again.
              The first offical day of spring is March 20th. In some parts of the US Spring can start soon and last much longer, but in other areas, the winter time is so severe that spring is very short and summer seems to come unexpectedly.
