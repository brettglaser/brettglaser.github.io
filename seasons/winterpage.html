            <p><img src="winter-tree.png" class="pic"> Winter is the coldest season out of the four. Winter makes for fridged temperatures, short days, and rough outdoor conditions. People bundle up during the winter time to keep from getting cold and to prevent them from getting hypothermia. Winter is known to be more brutal and colder the more north you travel in the United States.
          Winter does however bring people together for iceskating, skiing & snowboarding, and snowball fights. So though the wintertime might not be everyones favorite season, it does have some advantages.
Winter is offically said to start on December 21st. </p>
