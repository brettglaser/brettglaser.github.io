  Good Website #1:
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/"> Amazon </a>
    <p>
      Amazon's website design is very clean and very nice to look at. It is very easy to navigate through and I feel I find
      exactly what I am looking for. The source code is very clean and organized, and they use many html elements such as
      name, property, href, link, etc. Along with the html elements there are some elements in which I have never seen. There
      seems to only be four colors but this is not a bad thing for they match very well and are very appealing to the eye.
      Some of the little things I enjoy are the how the webiste recomends items I might like or items that I purchase frequently.
      Also I like how Amazon gives you the option to give a rating on the last product that you purchased. The only thing that
      I can complain about is that the webiste does not form to mobile when I minimize the screen down. Other little things are
      that amazon shows you a daily deal so that way you can get more bang for your buck.

  Good Website #2:
  <a href="https://www.nike.com/"> Nike </a>
    <p>
      Nike's website has a sleek design with people modeling their products on their page which makes it look very nice. For I
      enjoy seeing their products in a modern setting. The website is very easy to navigate through and is not confusing, it
      even has tables that allow me to check off certain parameters so that the products I'm looking for can get narrowed down.
      The source code has html elements inside of them along with some css elements as well. The website only holds one main color
      and its white. I personally really like this because this way the other boxes inside the website that take you to other products
      more attention. Nike's website also adapts to mobile perfectly. Some little things are that Nike highlights cheaper markdowns
      so that way you can save money, they also show featured styles to keep you up to date.

    Bad Website:
    <a href="https://helena.craigslist.org/"> Craigslist </a>
    <p>
      Craigslist in my opinion is a very bad website. The design looks like somebody just slapped every single possible product
      link onto a website page. It is a job to have to navigate through this website, for it will take you forever to find
      what you want. Also there are some tabs you can click on that are not only straight up confusing, but it would be safe
      to say that they are rather controversial. The website is also very ugly, there is only one color white and that is it.
      Nike only had one color but they also had fantastic artwork and photography that stood out because of the white color.
      Craigslist has zero pictures or art work and it makes the website look rather ugly and bland. The source code also seems
      to be strictly only html, and it is safe to say I have seen most if not all the elements that are in the source code.
      Some little things that bug me as well are things like the "craigslist calendar", I also dislike how the website somehow
      already knows my location.
